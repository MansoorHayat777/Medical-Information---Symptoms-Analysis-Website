		<h4>What is it?</h4>
		<p>
		<span>
			Cyramza (ramucirumab) is a cancer medicine that interferes with the growth and spread of cancer cells in the body.

			Cyramza is used to treat stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, or non-small cell lung cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. Ramucirumab may be given alone or in combination with other cancer medicines.

			Cyramza is usually given after other cancer medicines have been tried without success.
