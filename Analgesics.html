	<h2>ANALGESICS (PAIN KILLER)</h2>
		<h4>What is it?</h4>
		<p>
		<span>
			These medications help reduce pain, but have no effect on inflammation. Examples include acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), tramadol (Ultram, Ultracet, others) and narcotics containing oxycodone (Percocet, Oxycontin, others) or hydrocodone (Norco, Vicoprofen, others).

		<h4>Uses</h4>
		<p>
		<span>	
			The analgesics can be used for either short-term or long-term relief of severe pain. In contrast, the anti-inflammatory compounds are used for short-term pain relief and for modest pain, such as that of headache, muscle strain, bruising, or arthritis.
